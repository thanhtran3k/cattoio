A basic chat room website. Go to the website, type your username and you're in.

- I'm using "server.js" main file instead of "app.js" like used to use in the previous projects.

1. Download my project to your computer.
2. Install the packages by typing "npm install" on git bash.
3. Run the the project: "npm start".
