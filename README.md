# cattoio
A basic chat room website. Go to the website, type your username and you're in.

- In this project. I was using only Socket.io (Real-time framework), ExpressJS and NodeJS, HTML for the front-end.
- Socket.io going to open connection between the client and the server instead of making request and response. That makes everything pretty much instant.
- I'm using "server.js" main file instead of "app.js" like used to use in the previous projects.

1. Download my project to your computer.
2. Install the packages by typing "npm install" on git bash.
3. Run the the project: "npm start".
